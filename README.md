# 🎨 Sprite Sheet Management System

An integrated system combining a Django-based frontend with a Java backend to manage and analyze sprite sheets efficiently. This application allows users to interact with sprite data, perform CRUD operations, and visualize sprite information through a user-friendly web interface.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of the **Java Technologies Laboratory Work** and demonstrates real-world usage of:

- **Django Framework** – For building the web-based frontend
- **Java with JDBC** – For backend operations and database connectivity
- **MySQL** – As the relational database management system
- **RESTful API** – For communication between the frontend and backend

It was developed as a **mini-project** by students of Dharmsinh Desai University.
